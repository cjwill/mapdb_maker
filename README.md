# mapdb_maker
Python script that autogenerates a mapdb.json file from a Quake 1 map directory.

Drop the python script into the base directory of your mod and run.  

Directory Name, Episode Name, and Mod Folder are typically the name of the folder the script was placed in (i.e. FORTRESS for Team Fortress.)  Mod Name can be a longer description of the map list.
